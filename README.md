# Kodex Comments

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide visually clear, concise comments for use with various microcontrollers, such as Feather, Arduino, Onion Omega2S+, XIAO ESP32 S3, Trinket/Trinket Pro/Trinket M0, and more. These comments help define and remind users of the wiring, boards, modules, and sensors being used in their projects.

I have designed these boards with ASCII art with inspiration from Duckman his project makes it easier to visualize pin usage and overall hardware setup. The comments are designed to simplify the development process by offering an easy reference for used components.

## Features
- **Microcontroller Support**: Comments tailored for a wide variety of microcontrollers.
- **Clear Documentation**: Headers for name, author, description, and project details.
- **ASCII Art**: Visual representations of the boards for easy identification of pins.
- **Open Source**: Available for use in any project under the selected open-source license.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to suggest support for a new board, please open an issue on GitHub. Your issue should include the following details:

1. **Name of the board**
2. **Chip used on board**  
3. **Manufacturer**  
4. **Link to the website or datasheet**  

This process helps maintain clarity and ensures all necessary information is provided when adding support for new hardware.
